# ü´Ä Heart Disease Prediction System

A Python-based heart disease prediction system using machine learning (Logistic Regression), with a graphical interface built in Tkinter. User inputs are logged into a local SQLite database for future reference.

## Features

- *Machine Learning Model**: Trained using the UCI Heart Disease dataset with Logistic Regression.
- *Tkinter GUI**: Simple form for users to input medical data and get predictions.
- *Real-time Predictions**: Tells whether the person is likely to have heart disease or not.
- *SQLite Logging**: Every prediction is stored locally with all inputs and timestamp.
- *UI Enhancement Support**: Background image and heart logo can be added optionally.
